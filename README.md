**WD PDF Extractor** is a simple and efficient tool for extracting text from scanned PDF files using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). With this application, you can avoid paying for OCR services like "iLovePDF" and instead leverage open-source tools to process PDF files on your local machine. The application is built using `pdf2image` and `pytesseract` for OCR functionality and `ReportLab` for saving the extracted text into a new PDF file.
